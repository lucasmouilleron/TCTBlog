As personal and professional recording systems are more and more affordable and usable, 360° and panoramic videos are becoming real.
Overview from recording to reading.

##Recording systems

###It's all about projections !
Recording a _3 dimensions_ scene on _2 dimensions_ support (the video or picture file) implies _projections_.

Depending on the recording system, the projection methods on the ouput stream varies.

###Catadioptry and omnidirectional camera
Most omnidirectional cameras use catadioptry to produce a wider panoramic images. 
It invovles _reflexion and refraction on hyperboloid mirors_ which are captured by a _traditional planar sensor_.

The hyperboloid projected images are geometrically correct perspective images. It means, when unwarped, the images feel coherent when presented to a human being.

The following products are affordable and can be used with standard DSLR, iPhone or can operate standalone.

###Multiple cameras
Using mutliple cameras is a _bit more expensive_ but provides a _better image resolution_.

All multiple cameras systems have to deal with _stitching the mutiple videos streams in one planar video_.

Considering only the the case of single viewpoint systems (the cameras viewpoints are the same single viewpoint), the stitching consists of _concatenating the videos_, perform some _color normalizations_ across the multiple sources, and finally _projecting_ them on a plane surface.

Some systems embed the _stitching onboard_, which is super convenient as it ouputs a single output video file or stream reeady to be played.

![Equirectangular projection](http://haveidols.com/grabs/Screen%20Shot%202014-06-26%20at%2010.52.16.png)

Most systems use _equirectangular projections_ as it is processing light and works well for panorama viewing.
This projection is as well called the "no projection" because abscissa is longitude and ordinate is latitude and no scales are applied.

##Reading videos
Reading panoramic videos (or pictures) is about projecting a planar video (or picture) on a 3D sphere which simulates the world.

Depending on how the original rays were projected on the planar video, the re-projection on the 3D sphere varies.

###In the browser with webGL
- [Valiant360](http://flimshaw.github.io/Valiant360) : a simple aquirectangular jquery plugin
- [Three.JS example](http://mrdoob.github.io/three.js/examples/webgl_panorama_equirectangular.html) : three.js equirectangular implementation
- [Equiangular Unwarp](https://github.com/gwbond/equiangular-unwarp) : js hyperboloid / stereographic unwarping

###On devices
- [Kolor](http://www.kolor.com/360-video/kolor-eyes-ios-sdk-360-video-player.html) : SDK for iOS, 4 projections, touch and gyroscope control
- [Panorama](https://github.com/robbykraft/Panorama) : iOS still panorama lib

###With Oculus
- Some recording systems provide Oculus and ohter VR devices players
- [VR Player](http://vrplayer.codeplex.com) : standalone player, multiple projections (sphere would be equirectangular)
- http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/projects/cat_cam_360/images/immersive_video.mpg

##Bonus : Fun with stereorgaphic projection
